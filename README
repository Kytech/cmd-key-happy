Swap cmd/alt keys in Mac OS X.

This program allows you to swap the command and alt keys in any
application, but particularly in Terminal.app.  This can be extremely
handy when ssh'ing into other UN*X boxes and running Emacs.  It also
allows me to have the traditional readline navigation work "properly"
when working in Bash (i.e., alt-backspace, alt-f, alt-b, etc).

The decision to swap the keys is based on a customizable script (Lua).
This allows you to exclude certain key combinations per application.
For example, "cmd-tab" is an exclusion in my Lua script when
Terminal.app has focus; I still want this key combination to cycle
the active set of applications.

The motivation for this program was years of hitting alt-<something>
in Linux only to find that it does not map to the same behaviour in
Mac OS X.  Having the ability to run "emacs -nw" in ssh sessions is
now both feasible and useable!
