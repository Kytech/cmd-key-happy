Build, Installation and Usage Instructions
==========================================

For those in a hurry:

	make
	./cmd-key-happy -d -f example-rcfile.lua

For those with a little more time:

Typing `make' will build the cmd-key-happy executable.  This can be
installed via `sudo make install', which by default installs to
/usr/local/bin.  Once built you'll need the sample Lua script
installed as ~/.cmd-key-happy.lua.  This can be done via: `make
install-rcfile'.  You'll probably want to edit the defaults as some of
the exclusions are for my own benefit (read years of hitting key
sequences that simply won't leave my fingers), but the sample serves
as an example of what can be done.

The com.frobware.cmd-key-happy.plist file is for launchd.  Running
`make install-plist' will create a ~/Library/LaunchAgents directory,
copy the plist file and start the service using launchctl.  Note:
because we're using launchd cmd-key-happy will now start every time
you login.

Messages from cmd-key-happy are logged via syslog.

Changes to the rcfile (~/.cmd-key-happy.lua) are automatically
detected by cmd-key-happy, assuming it is running, so there is
no "stop cmd-key-happy, tweak the .lua file, start cmd-key-happy"
sequence.
