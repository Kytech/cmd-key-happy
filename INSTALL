Build, Installation and Usage Instructions
==========================================

This program requires that "Enable access for assistive devices is
turned ON".  This setting can be found in "System Preferences /
Universal Access".

For those in a hurry:

  $ make
  $ ./cmd-key-happy -d -f example-rcfile.lua

For those with a little more time:

Build the application:

  $ make

Install into /usr/local/bin:

  $ sudo make install

Copy the sample rcfile (example-rcfile.lua) to ~/.cmd-key-happy.lua:

  $ make install-rcfile

**** Mavericks only ****
  $ make install-security-exception-for-cmd-key-happy
*** End Mavericks only ****

Install the launchd configuration:

  $ make install-plist

At this point cmd-key-happy should be running and any messages are
logged via syslog.

This application is most useful when trying to use readline naviation
in Terminal.app.  With cmd-key-happy running and "Use option as meta
key" checked in Terminal's preferences you can now get the same
readline navigation behaviour you would get if you were using either
an xterm or iTerm - and that is much more desirable than trying to get
my thumb to use the alt (or option) key.

I have also declared my Terminal type as "rxvt" and with this I can
ssh into remote Linux boxes and have cmd act as the alt key.  Using
rxvt seems to be the missing link in having a usable "emacs -nw" on
remote machines.
