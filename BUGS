Known Bugs
==========

1. cmd-key-happy can occasionally stop working on Snow Leopard when
   waking from sleep.  Note: I haven't seen this issue on Leopard.  To
   remedy this (because I haven't found a fix yet) run:

   $ cmd-key-happy-restart

2. cmd-key-happy attempts to detect changes to the resource file
   (~/.cmd-key-happy.lua) and automatically reload it without having
   to restart the program.  Unfortunately, this only works for simple
   file changes (i.e., when the file referenced by the descriptor has
   been extended) and not for renames.  Renames can occur when using
   Emacs, for example.  This problem _can_ be fixed and it is just
   waiting on me to do something about it.  In the meantime if you
   think your changes are not being picked up run:

   $ cmd-key-happy-restart

3. Running `cmd-key-happy-restart' to fix all problems is a bug!
